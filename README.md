# barry-brown : 'ru-alan-practice'

This branch of the project serves as a form of practice for automation testing, and was done by Rupert and Alan.

It is a **Cypress** project that targets the internal 'Barry Brown' website.

## How and What We Did

Rupert and Alan were tasked with creating a Cypress project for the Barry Brown site.

This was an internal task that was originally scoped to Monday 17th and Tuesday 18th February.

We collaborated throughout the entire development cycle. And to help us, we outlined markers we wanted to achieve at the start of each day.


### 17/02/2025

- Get brief on what was required (the spec)
- Set up repo in GitHub, attached to 'zoonouqa' organisation
- Configure 'SourceTree' Git UI client and clone repo
- Create .gitignore file (tailored for Node.js, Cypress, and Cucumber)
- Install and configure Cypress
- Install and configure Cucumber
- Teething issues and fixes
- Verify project working with small-scale test in Cypress and Cucumber formats
- Branch off of 'main'; leaving it in a "launch-pad" state for other automation testers to perform the same exercise done here
- From this 'ru-alan-practice' branch, branch off again; branch each for the pages we would develop for
- Complete a set of test cases in Cucumber for 'Home' and 'About Us' pages


### 18/02/2025

- Continued work from yesterday.
- Added pages and tests for Services, Quote Request, Testimonials, Where We Are, and Contact.
- Gallery has been ignored as there is little to automate, and in a real-world scenario, automation would not be necessary for this section.
- Refactoring was done on the Contact Us page as well as parts of the Where We Are page.
- Research was conducted on Azure DevOps to explore ways to run all tests. A short-term solution has been implemented within the config to execute all tests within Cypress.
    - The only caveat with this approach is that the results are stored in a local environment rather than a cloud-based environment.
- All additional branches worked on have been merged into the primary Ru and Alan Practice branch.
